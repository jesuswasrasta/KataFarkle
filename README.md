# Kata Farkle

In the following kata we will play a variation of the classical [Farkle Dice Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle).  

In this version I put together a simplified set of rules, just to practicing Object Calisthenics.  

## Rules

* 2 players, in turn, roll 6 dice
* The score is calculated according to the standard rules represented in the image below
* If your score is 500+ points, you are entitled to make another throw
* The first one that reaches (or overcomes) 10.000 points, wins

## Vocabulary

3 of a kind = triplet  
4 of a kind = quatern  
5 of a kind = five  

## Notes

* The 1 and 5 are the only dice that score even if the amount is less than 3
* Three dice of one type give points equal to their value multiplicated by 100 
  (e.g. a triplet of dice 2 gives 200 points), except for one type: a triplet of 1 gives 1000 points
* The quaternes doubles the triplet points 
  (e.g. a quatern of dice 2 gives 400 points)
* The five triples the triplet points 
  (e.g. a five of 2 gives 600)

## Standard scoring

These are the standard scores for single dice or combinations of dice:  

| Dice combination | Score |

| Each 5           | 50    |
